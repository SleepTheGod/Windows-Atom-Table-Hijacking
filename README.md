Shellcode Injection using Atom Bombing
This code demonstrates how to inject shellcode into a running process on Windows using a technique called "Atom Bombing." Atom Bombing is a relatively new technique that exploits the Windows atom tables to inject arbitrary code into a process. This technique bypasses traditional security measures like antivirus software and can be used to elevate privileges, steal sensitive information, or execute malicious code.

Usage
To use this code, simply compile it into an executable and run it as an administrator. The code will locate the explorer.exe process and inject the shellcode string into the atom table of the ntdll.dll module. Once the code is injected, it can be executed by calling the GetProcAddress function with the name of the atom as an argument.
